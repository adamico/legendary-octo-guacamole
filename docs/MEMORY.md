## Current Context
The project is a Picotron game (Lua-based) using an ECS architecture.

### Recent Activities
- **Implemented FSM-based animation system** with per-frame durations, composite sprites, and velocity-based direction.
- Updated architecture documentation.
- Implemented knockback and invulnerability.
- Fixed palette-aware lighting and spotlight effects.
- Refactored player movement to use ECS (controllable, acceleration, velocity systems).
- Fixed map collision issues.
- Established context workflow in `.agent/workflows/context.md`.
