# TODO

- fix player projectiles pass through unlocked doors [PENDING]
- maybe change the room to room transition to be similar to enter the gungeon (corridor between rooms, with the camera transition we use right now but with adjusted offsets to start the transition in the middle of the corridor) [PENDING]
- maybe let the skull spawn in locked combat rooms but with longer delay to add pressure [PENDING]
- improve player projectile damage to 20 [PENDING]
