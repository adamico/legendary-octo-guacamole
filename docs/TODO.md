# TODO

- add random enemy movement to enemies when they are not tracking the player [PENDING]
- increase entity speed to account for bigger rooms [PENDING]
- add room carvings patterns similar to the ones in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth [PENDING]

## Ideas

- add enemies emotions/expressions (! when spotted the player, ? when lost the player, etc.) [PENDING]
- maybe add a mechanic to react to the player being hurt (blood lost, etc.) [PENDING]
- brainstorm ways to improve the health recovery system [PENDING]
