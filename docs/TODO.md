## Ideas

- should we scale the sprites up? 24x24? 32x32? [PENDING]
- add enemy group patterns similar to the ones in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth [PENDING]
- add room carvings patterns similar to the ones in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth [PENDING]
- add room features system to allow creating solid obstacles which impede entities movement , block line of sight, etc. [PENDING]

- maybe add a mechanic to react to the player being hurt (blood lost, etc.) [PENDING]
