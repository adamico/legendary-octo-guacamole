# Pizza Theme & Collectibles

Brainstorming for a **Pizza/Italian Deli** theme for the game's economy and collectibles, aligned with the **Health-as-Ammunition** mechanic.

## 1. Currency: "Slices" or "Tips"

Instead of generic coins, use something that fits the Deli world.

- **The Nickel Pizak**: A small silver coin used in **Shops** or **Vending Ovens**.
- **Pizza Slices**: Could be the currency itself. You "pay" by giving away slices.
- **Usage**: Buying "Toppings" (Passive Items), "Sides" (Consumables), or donating to a **Tip Jar** for permanent meta-progression.

## 2. Keys: "Pizza Cutters" or "Dough Knots"

Keys are used to gate the best rewards (Treasure Rooms, Golden Boxes).

- **Dough Knots**: Ornate, twisted dough shapes that fit into "locks" (which could look like mouths or ovens).
- **Pizza Cutter Handles**: Ornate handles that "unlock" take-out boxes.
- **The Master Dough (Rare)**: A rare golden key that stays with you for the whole floor but makes you 10% slower due to its weight.

## 3. Bombs: "The Pressure Cookers" or "Calzones"

Used for combat and finding secret rooms (like "The Freezer" or "The Pantry").

- **Dough-mbs**: Pressurized balls of dough that explode into sticky white residue, slowing enemies caught in the blast.
- **Spicy Meatballs**: Standard red-coded bombs that deal high damage and leave a small "fire" (sauce) trail.
- **The Stuffed Crust (Rare)**: On explosion, it releases 4 smaller cheese-shrapnel bits that seek out nearby enemies.

## 4. Hearts (Ammunition Mods)

Since health is ammo, different "Heart" types can change the properties of the projectiles you fire.

- **Red Slice (Standard)**: Standard ammo/health.
- **Garlic Clove (White)**: Firing this segment creates a "Stink Aura" around the projectile, dealing tick damage to enemies it passes.
- **Anchovy Heart (Black)**: "Curse Ammo." Firing this segment deals 2x damage, but if you take damage while this segment is active, you lose a full extra segment.
- **Pineapple Slice (Blue)**: "Ghost Ammo." These segments are discarded when fired (they don't drop pickups on walls), but they effectively act as Armor/Shields.

## 5. Consumables: "The Menu Extras"

Single-use items (like Isaac’s Pills/Cards).

- **Extra Red Pepper**: For 10 seconds, all shots apply a "Burn" effect.
- **Cold Pizza**: Heals a large amount of HP but halves your movement speed for 5 seconds (the "Food Coma" effect).
- **Delivery Receipt**: Instantly reveals the map layout of the current floor.
- **Marinara Dip**: Temporary damage boost for the current room.

## 6. Breakables (Interactable Environment)

- **Pizza Boxes**: Standard crates. Can contain Slices or Dough Knots.
- **Flour Sacks**: Explode into a "smoke screen" (white particles) when hit, making enemies lose sight of you briefly.
- **Olive Oil Bottles**: Create "Slippery Tiles" on the floor that increase movement speed but reduce control.
