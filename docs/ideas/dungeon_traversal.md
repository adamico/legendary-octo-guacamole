# Dungeon Traversal Ideas

Brainstorming ways to make room/dungeon traversal more **interesting** and **quick**.

## 1. Movement Mechanics (Quickness)

### Dodge Roll / Dash

- High-speed burst ability for rapid repositioning.
- *Twist:* Invulnerability frames during dash (defensive + offensive utility), or ability to "vault" over small pits.

### Room-Clear Rush

- Temporary +50% speed boost for 3-5 seconds after last enemy dies.
- Encourages "flow" into the next room while reward feeling is high.

### Passive Speed Momentum

- Moving in a straight line for >1 second without hitting walls or taking damage increases speed by 20%.
- Reduces backtracking tedium.

### Slippery Tiles / Speed Pads

- Ice tiles that modify velocity (sliding).
- Turbo pads placed near room entrances to launch players toward center.

## 2. Environmental Interaction (Interest)

### Destructible Obstacles (Pots/Crates)

- Breakable sprites filling empty space.
- Satisfying feedback (screenshake + particles).
- Can drop small ammo/health pickups.

### Procedural Room Features (Rocks/Pits)

- **Rocks**: Block movement, not projectiles.
- **Pits**: Block movement and projectiles (or just movement).
- Forces navigation instead of "hold direction" traversal.

### Environmental Hazards

- **Conveyor Belts**: Tiles that push entities.
- **Spike Traps**: Retracting spikes requiring timing.

### Inter-room Shortcuts

- **Secret Walls**: Bombable walls leading to adjacent rooms (skip 2-3 rooms).
- **One-way Trapdoors**: Teleporters back to Hub/Shop/Starting room.

## 3. Visual & Game-Feel Polish

### Screenshake & Particles

- Trailing "dust" when moving at full speed.
- "Thump" effect when hitting walls.

### Dynamic Room Scaling

- Zoom camera out or change lighting in cleared rooms to signal "safe zone."

### Wall Sliding (Expanded)

- Extend door guidance so player doesn't snag on obstacle corners.
- Makes navigation feel smooth and responsive.
