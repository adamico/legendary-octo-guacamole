# Mutation System (powerup ideas)

The main concept of the mutation system is to allow nudging the player towards a certain playstyle. Each mutation should improve one of the three main playstyles:

- egg-based playstyle (egg throwing is the main damage source)
- chick-based playstyle (chick minions are the main damage source)
- mixed playstyle (both egg throwing and chick minions are the main damage source)
- brawler playstyle (movement/melee is the main damage source)
