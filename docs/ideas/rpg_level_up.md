# RPG Level Up

## Mechanics

When a monster dies, it drops genetic material (DNA) that can be used to level up the player's stats.

When the player levels up, it is presented with a choice of 3 upgrade options:

- one option is linked to a player stat (health, move speed, etc.)
- one option is linked to the egg projectile
- one option is linked to a stat of the chick minions
