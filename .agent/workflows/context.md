# Antigravity Context Maintenance

To ensure optimal performance and long-term project alignment, Antigravity should always follow these steps at the beginning of a task and after significant changes:

1. **Read Memory**: At the start of a session or a major task, check `docs/MEMORY.md` to understand the current state, goals, and recent history.
2. **Consult Docs**: Refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md` for technical and aesthetic constraints.
3. **Update Memory**: Whenever a significant feature is implemented, a bug is fixed, or an architectural decision is made, update `docs/MEMORY.md` with the new information.
4. **Follow Workflows**: Check `.agent/workflows/` for specific procedures relevant to the current task.
